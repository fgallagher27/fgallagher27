### Hi there 👋

I'm Felix and I'm motivated by learning new things and taking on new challenges.

I'm working as data scientist and enjoy applying data science to sustainability and climate issues.  
I'm currently working mostly on buiding models of carbon markets.

- 📘 I studied Economics at University of Oxford
- 🧠 I am learning ML in python with the Deeplearning.ai Deep Learning Specialisation
- 🌍 I have modelled extreme physical risks, low carbon commodity demand, and carbon markets
